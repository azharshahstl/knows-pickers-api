The Reason for building this App. 
// Both Facebook Marketplace and Nextdoor allow people to sell items to others by through their repsective apps.  However, both of them require to connect in order to share certain information such as an address( if items are to be picked up), as well as a time and date of the transaction.  This is true even for items that are being given away.  

The pupose of this app is to streamline the process and allow people to put whatever items they want to give away in the alleyway behind their house and pin the items to a location on google maps with a list of the items available for free.  Then, people can check the different pins on the map and see what items are available and where and got pick them up, without having to first contact the donator.  The person who picked up the donated items can then go to the map and delete whatever items were taken from a particular pin on the map.  Since this app will be community focused, it will rely on the community of users to be responsible while using the app and not delete items which were not taken.  Items are offered on a "first come first serve" basis.  

This app can be useful not only to individuals, but organizations such as churches and GoodWill, who could use it to look for items of special interest to them.  Even people who drive around looking for scrap metal can find this app usefull and help them focus on certain areas instead of randomly driving down alleyways.
